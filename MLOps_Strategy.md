# MLOps & CI/CD Strategy

## 1. Automating Model Training & Retraining

- **Tools:** MLflow and Apache Airflow
- **Process:**
  - **MLflow:**
    - Set up an MLflow experiment to track model parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
    - Log experiments automatically during each training run.
  - **Airflow:**
    - Schedule training jobs using Airflow DAGs.
    - Trigger retraining based on data drift or scheduled intervals.

## 2. Deploying Models with Docker & Kubernetes

- **Containerization:**
  - Create a Dockerfile to containerize the FastAPI application.
  - Ensure that the Docker image includes all necessary dependencies.
- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the containerized application using Kubernetes.
  - Configure auto-scaling and rolling updates for high availability.
  - Use Kubernetes health checks to monitor the APIâ€™s performance.

## 3. Model Monitoring & Drift Detection

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Use Evidently AI or custom logging to monitor real-time model performance.
  - Set up dashboards to track metrics such as accuracy, prediction latency, and data distribution.
- **Drift Detection:**
  - Compare incoming data distributions with the training data.
  - Define thresholds for performance degradation.
  - Configure alerts for when significant drift is detected.
